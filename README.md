# ChromaNetApp
# ** STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION ** 
Colorize any grayscale image from the 1800s to 1900s using AEs in PyTorch
**Updates: Still working to improve graphic quality + CUDA optimization**

# What is ChromaNet?
An AE that converts grayscale landscape images to coloured images.

ConvTranspose2d layer with input channel of 256, output channel of 64, kernel size of 3, stride of 2, padding of 1, and output padding of 1
ConvTranspose2d layer with input channel of 128, output channel of 128, kernel size of 3, stride of 2, padding of 1, and output padding of 1
ConvTranspose2d layer with input channel of 192, output channel of 15, kernel size of 3, stride of 1, and padding of 1

Dropout layer with a dropout rate of 0.2

**Converge Layer:**
Conv2d layer with input channel of 16, output channel of 2, kernel size of 3, stride of 1, and padding of 1

The model takes an input image with a single channel, applies several convolutional and max-pooling layers to encode it into a compressed representation, and then applies several transposed convolutional layers to reconstruct the original image. Finally, the model passes the reconstructed image through a converging convolutional layer to reduce the number of channels to 2. The output of the model is the compressed representation of the input image.
